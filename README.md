# Parking-automata
The list of cars are provided in a list, first how many cars there are, followed by the cars and their size (eg. width and height). The program loads these cars in a list, and rearranges them in a descending order based on their width and size (or both) thus placing the exceptionally large ones first and filling the gaps with the smaller cars after.
